# Release Runbook

## Sources Of Truth

- Version metadata: [../meta/release-current.yml](../meta/release-current.yml)
- Release index: [../releases/README.md](../releases/README.md)
- Changelog window: [../releases/CHANGELOG.md](../releases/CHANGELOG.md)
- Current release note is the `release_doc` pointed to by metadata.

## Metadata-Driven Release State

- `doc/meta/release-current.yml` is the only machine-readable source for current version, release date, release note path, profile linkage, and last verified timestamp.
- `doc/releases/README.md` is the human-friendly portal that mirrors the current metadata window.
- Do not hand-maintain current version/date in multiple active docs.

## Build Injection

- `CFBundleShortVersionString = $(MARKETING_VERSION)`
- `CFBundleVersion = $(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`
- `scripts/version.sh` remains the build-time source for `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`.

## Release Steps

1. Update [../meta/release-current.yml](../meta/release-current.yml), the new release note under [../releases/history/](../releases/history/README.md), [../releases/README.md](../releases/README.md), and [../releases/CHANGELOG.md](../releases/CHANGELOG.md).
2. Add or explicitly skip a release profile in [../perf/release-profiles/](../perf/release-profiles/README.md).
3. Run `make docs-validate`.
4. Run `make release-validate`.
5. Create the tag with `make tag-release`.
6. Push `main` and the tag with `make push-release`.
7. Wait for the `Build and Release` workflow to publish `Scopy-<version>.dmg` and `.sha256`.
8. Verify Homebrew sync and installation.

## Release Environment

- Release CI currently targets `macos-15`.
- Project baseline remains `macOS 14.0` and `Xcode 16.0` unless intentionally changed in project configuration and workflows.

## Verification Expectations

- Baseline build/tests: `make build`, `make test-unit`
- Concurrency-sensitive changes: `make test-strict`, and `make test-tsan` when the environment permits
- Perf-sensitive changes:
  - `make test-snapshot-perf-release`
  - `make perf-frontend-profile`
  - `make perf-unified-table` when comparing frontend and backend evidence

## Homebrew Acceptance

Verify all of the following after release publication:

1. `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Suehn/Scopy/main/Casks/scopy.rb | sed -n '1,12p'`
2. `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Suehn/homebrew-scopy/main/Casks/scopy.rb | sed -n '1,12p'`
3. `brew tap Suehn/scopy`
4. `brew update`
5. `brew info --cask scopy`
6. `brew fetch --cask scopy -f`
7. Confirm `/Applications/Scopy.app` exists

## Historical Material

- Legacy deployment notes are preserved in [../archive/release-runbook-legacy.md](../archive/release-runbook-legacy.md).
- Older changelog entries live under [../archive/changelog/](../archive/changelog/README.md).
